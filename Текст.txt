This law has long been known A world without songs is uninteresting, 
But even if it rains in the morning.
 It is necessary that people know for sure There is no reason for sadness 
Tomorrow everything will be better than yesterday. 
Wake up and sing, Wake up and sing. 
Try for once in your life-Not to let a smile out of your open eyes.
 Let Him choose capricious success from those who can laugh at themselves first.
 Sing while falling asleep, Sing in a dream, Wake up and sing. Forget everything that has passed!
 What has fallen is gone, What has gone, You can't bring it back.
 Only there and There is no return, What is now incredible will happen again tomorrow morning. 
Wake up and sing, Wake up and sing. Try for once in your life-Not to let a smile out of your open eyes. 
Let Him choose capricious success from those who can laugh at themselves first. Sing while falling asleep, Sing in a dream, Wake up and sing. 
Children often hear from adults That everything in the world has been crushed â€“ People, rains and everything that you can take.
 Apparently, they forgot that at first their Grandfathers grumbled about the same thing to them,
 And yet the world is still good! Wake up
